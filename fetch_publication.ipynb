       "  'abstract': 'MQTT is the dominant lightweight publish--subscribe protocol for IoT deployments, yet edge security remains inadequate. Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\\\\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\\\\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency. These results show that protocol-aware MQTT filtering can be efficiently realized in the programmable data plane, providing a practical foundation for edge IoT security. Future work will validate the design on production P4 hardware and integrate machine learning--based threshold adaptation.'},\n",

However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.'},\n",

Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis.

Simulating very deep quantum machine learning models requires a lot of resources, increasing exponentially based on the number of qubits and polynomially based on the depth value. Almost all related works use state-vector-based simulators due to their parallelization and scalability. Extended stabilizer formalism simulators solve the same problem with fewer computations because they act on stabilizers rather than long vectors. However, the gate application sequential property leads to less popularity and poor performance. In this work, we parallelize the process, making it feasible to deploy on multi-core devices.

However, these models often struggle to perform effectively under domain shift conditions, where the training data (the source domain) is related to but exhibits different distributions from the testing data (the target domain). To address this challenge, previous studies have attempted to reduce the domain gap between source and target data by incorporating a few labeled target samples during training—a technique known as semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA). While this strategy has demonstrated notable improvements in classification performance, the network architectures used in these approaches primarily focus on exploiting the features of individual images, leaving room for improvement in capturing rich representations. In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Graph of Nodes designed to simultaneously present representations at both feature and category levels. At the feature level, we introduce a local graph to identify the most relevant patches within an image, facilitating adaptability to defined main object representations. At the category level, we employ a global graph to aggregate the features from samples within the same category, thereby enriching overall representations.

The aim is to capture both local and global aspects of an individual for precise attribute recognition. To facilitate the understanding of intricate relationships among channels, a channel-aware self-attention mechanism is devised and integrated into each SwinT block.

The theoretical analysis of the QEA on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA, using varying numbers of PEs and different depths of unitary and local data memory, reveals a linear increase in memory depth with the number of qubits. This scaling highlights the potential of the EMMS-based QEA to accommodate larger quantum circuits, providing insights into selecting appropriate memory sizes and FPGA devices. Furthermore, the estimated performance of the QEA with PE counts ranging from  to  on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA demonstrates that increasing the number of PEs significantly reduces the computation cycle count for circuits with fewer than 18 qubits, making it significantly faster than previous works.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lane detection is one of the most fundamental problems in the rapidly developing field of autonomous vehicles. With the dramatic growth of deep learning in recent years, many models have achieved a high accuracy for this task. However, most existing deep-learning methods for lane detection face two main problems. First, most early studies usually follow a segmentation approach, which requires much post-processing to extract the necessary geometric information about the lane lines. Second, many models fail to reach real-time speed due to the high complexity of model architecture. To offer a solution to these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network that requires only two small arrays for minimum post-processing, instead of segmentation maps for the task of lane detection. This proposed network utilizes a simple lane representation format for its output. The proposed model can achieve 93.53% accuracy on the TuSimple dataset. A hardware accelerator is proposed and implemented on the Virtex-7 VC707 FPGA platform to optimize processing time and power consumption. Several techniques, including data quantization to reduce data width down to 8-bit, exploring various loop-unrolling strategies for different convolution layers, and pipelined computation across layers, are optimized in the proposed hardware accelerator architecture. This implementation can process at 640 FPS while consuming only 10.309 W, equating to a computation throughput of 345.6 GOPS and energy efficiency of 33.52 GOPS/W.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness in traffic monitoring and potential for rapid delivery, and rescue support. Moreover, UAVs have been employed as a supporting machine in data collection for object detection tasks, in particular vehicle detection tasks in object recognition. Although vehicle identification is a tough problem, many of its challenges have recently been overcome by two-stage approaches such as Faster R-CNN, one of the most successful vehicle detectors. However, many critical problems still remain, such as partial occlusion, object truncation, object multi-angle rotation, etc. In this paper, we combine the Generic RoI Extractor (GroIE) method with Dynamic R-CNN and Side-aware Boundary Localization (SABL) for both testing and evaluation on a challenging dataset XDUAV. Overall, 4344 images in the XDUAV dataset, divided into 3 subsets: 3485 training images, 869 testing images and 869 validating images were used. These consisted of six object classes: 33841 “car”; 2690 “bus”; 2848 “truck”; 173 “tanker”; 6656 “motor” and 2024 “bicycle”. With the ResNet-101 backbone, our approach showed competitive results compared with the original GRoIE method, surpassed by 1.2% on mAP score and by about 2% on most classes AP scores, except for the class' tanker'.\"},\n",

However, because of the problem of a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM symbols can be distorted at the MIMO OFDM transmitter. It degrades the signal detection and channel estimation performance at the MIMO OFDM receiver. In this paper, three deep neural network (DNN) models are proposed to solve the problem of non-linear distortions introduced by the power amplifier (PA) of the transmitters and replace the conventional digital signal processing (DSP) modules at the receivers in 2 × 2 MIMO OFDM and 4 × 4 MIMO OFDM systems. Proposed model type I uses the DNN model to de-map the signals at the receiver. Proposed model type II uses the DNN model to learn and filter out the channel noises at the receiver. Proposed model type III uses the DNN model to de-map and detect the signals at the receiver. All three model types attempt to solve the non-linear problem. The robust bit error rate (BER) performances of the proposed receivers are achieved through the software and hardware implementation results. In addition, we have also implemented appropriate hardware architectures for the proposed DNN models using special techniques, such as quantization and pipeline to check the feasibility in practice, which recent studies have not done.

In detail, we first propose the TG2F module to enhance visual representations and the BERT-based language model to obtain language presentation. Through experiments on the VieCap4H dataset, our approach achieves competitive results on the public test and private test without using any data augmentation method.'},\n",

In the step of the generating proposal, a Regional Proposal Network (RPN) will be learned to suggest high probability regions in the image, and the part of Label Assignment for RPN is of great interest. If the samples are obtained well, RPN will learn well and help the efficiency of the next stage increase sharply.

This approached design can be integrated into the wireless communication system for factory automation (FA) devices. In order to increase the closeness of the PTP harmony, we propose two approaches to improve the accurate synchronization to the nanosecond level by reducing the effects of asymmetric path delays of transmissions between master (MS) and slave (SL). The first one is the PTP protocol implementation at PHY layer to remove the random transmission jitters caused by higher layers. The second one is the full hardware implementation to remove the imbalanced timing made by the uneven hardware designs between MS and SL. Besides, a low overhead 3-frames exchange PTP approach to increase throughput of the transmission system is presented. We also implement …'}]"
